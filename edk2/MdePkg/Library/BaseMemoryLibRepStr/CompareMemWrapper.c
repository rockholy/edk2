/**
  Compares the contents of two buffers.

  This function compares Length bytes of SourceBuffer to Length bytes of DestinationBuffer.
  If all Length bytes of the two buffers are identical, then 0 is returned.  Otherwise, the
  value returned is the first mismatched byte in SourceBuffer subtracted from the first
  mismatched byte in DestinationBuffer.
  If Length > 0 and DestinationBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length > 0 and SourceBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - SourceBuffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 


  @param  DestinationBuffer Pointer to the destination buffer to compare.
  @param  SourceBuffer      Pointer to the source buffer to compare.
  @param  Length            Number of bytes to compare.

  @return 0                 All Length bytes of the two buffers are identical.
  @retval Non-zero          The first mismatched byte in SourceBuffer subtracted from the first
                            mismatched byte in DestinationBuffer.
